This site was created by myself in 10th grade, in 2019.
At the commencement of this project, I had zero experience with PHP, and only had rudimentary HTML and CSS skills.
I used this as an opportunity to throw myself into the deep end, and learn quickly.

I have not touched the code since, and it is certainly not the cleanest nor the best organised code, but I wanted to retain it in it's original state to remind myself where I started.
